## Access Microsoft registry hive files from Python

A utility that can read Microsoft Windows registry hive files, e.g. c:/windows/system32/config/system. Information about the hive file format was taken from:
* http://www.reactos.org/
* http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/RegistryDumper.aspx

Also, the utility can modify/fix hive files in order to fix the common boot problem "Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM".
